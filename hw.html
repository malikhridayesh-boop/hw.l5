            <h1>Basket Ball</h1>
            <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams of five players each (excluding subs), opposing one another on a
            rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in
            diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.05 m) high to a
            backboard at each end of the court). Teams alternate between offense, when they attempt to score, and defense, when they
            try to prevent the opposing side from scoring. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point
            line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical
            foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if
            regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated. However, if the
            additional period still results in a tied score, yet another additional period is mandated. This goes on until the score
            is not tied anymore.
            
            Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of
            which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk;
            on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may
            collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's
            pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.
            
            The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the
            second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and
            the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implement the coach's
            game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play
            three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
            
            Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States,
            basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.[1][2] The National Basketball
            Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries,
            talent, and level of competition[3][4] (drawing most of its talent from U.S. college basketball). Outside North America,
            the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball
            Champions League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major
            international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world. Each continent hosts regional
            competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup.
